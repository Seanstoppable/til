I've had the reason to merge multiple repos together.
In all cases, I have wanted to preserve file history as much as possible.

This is pretty much the strategy that works for me:

cd path/to/project-b
git remote add project-a path/to/project-a
git fetch project-a --tags
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories project-a/master # or whichever branch you want to merge
git remote remove project-a

Resolve conflicts, test, and off you go!
